# How to use Vagrant to access your Virtual Machine

1. Download the .ova file with the so virtual machine from here:

`https://repository.grid.pub.ro/cs/so/linux-2019/so-ubuntu-18-04.ova`

2. Move it to a directory you know about, you can make a directory named "so":

`mkdir so`
`mv so-ubuntu-18-04.ova so`

3. Generate a .box file from the .ova file
